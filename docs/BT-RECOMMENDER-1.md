# BT-RECOMMENDER-1

BT-RECOMMENDER-1 is the first reusable BassThermal related-apps module for quiet in-app discovery panels (“More BassThermal tools”). It consumes BT-CATALOG-1 generated data (`/catalog-lite.json`) and renders compact ranked recommendations.

## Embed usage
```html
<div data-bt-related data-current-app="retrofy" data-limit="3"></div>
<script src="https://bassthermal.com/related-apps.v1.js"></script>
```

- `data-current-app`: current app id/slug (e.g., `retrofy`).
- `data-limit`: max cards (default `3`, max `6`).

Current app resolution order: element `data-current-app` → `window.BT_CURRENT_APP` → `<meta name="bt-app-id">` → `/apps/<slug>/` path inference.

## Placement guidance
Recommended placements:
- Help → More BassThermal tools
- About → More tools
- Settings → BassThermal
- Existing footer/sidebar locations

Forbidden placements:
- Startup popup
- Blocking modal
- Fake ad banner
- Giant promo panel

## Integration notes
- HTML/WebView: include script and a `data-bt-related` container.
- Electron: set `window.BT_CURRENT_APP` before calling `window.BTRelated.renderAll()`.
- Android WebView: same embed model; script captures its own origin at load time and fetches from that stable origin.
- Native fallback: if JS embedding is unavailable, link to `https://bassthermal.com/apps/`.

## Fetch/cache/fallback
- Fetch target: `<stable-script-origin>/catalog-lite.json`.
- Stable script origin is resolved once at load (`document.currentScript.src` when it is `related-apps.v1.js`, else scanning script tags for `related-apps.v1.js`).
- If origin cannot be determined, fallback origin is `https://bassthermal.com`.
- Recommended embed source: `https://bassthermal.com/related-apps.v1.js`, which then resolves catalog fetches to the same BassThermal origin.
- Cache keys: `bt.catalog-lite.v1` and `bt.catalog-lite.v1.ts`.
- TTL: 24 hours.
- Fallback order: fresh network → cached catalog → bundled emergency snapshot.
- Errors fail silently.

## No-random-cards policy
The widget must never show unrelated app cards just because an app is live/shipping. Recommendations only render when there is a real relationship.

Excludes current app, hidden apps, and apps where `visibility.showInAppOverlay !== true`.

## Scoring overview
`MIN_RELATIONSHIP_SCORE = 30`

Relationship score:
- `+100` current.relatedTools hit
- `+100` reverse relatedTools hit
- `+45` same primary family
- `+25` candidate primary in current secondary
- `+25` current primary in candidate secondary
- `+22` same non-`NONE` discipline
- shared modes `+12` each (cap `+36`)
- shared audiences `+8` each (cap `+24`)
- shared workflow stages `+8` each (cap `+32`)
- shared outputs `+10` each (cap `+30`)
- shared tags `+4` each (cap `+32`)

Status boost (tie-break only): live `+8`, shipping `+4`

Final score = relationshipScore + statusBoost.

Qualification rules:
- qualify if `current.relatedTools` includes candidate, or candidate `relatedTools` includes current, or `relationshipScore >= 30`
- status boost alone never qualifies
- below-threshold candidates are hidden from normal render output

Sort: qualified final score desc → live/shipping/lab → name A–Z.

If no recommendations qualify, render only a quiet fallback:
- title: `More BassThermal tools`
- link: `View all apps`

## Debug/explain support
`window.BTRelated.explain(currentAppId, catalog, options)` returns:
- `current`
- `recommendations` (qualified only)
- `rejected` (includes score, relationshipScore, statusBoost, reason, `rejectedReason: "below-threshold"`)

Debug output in rendered cards includes final score, relationship score, status, qualification path (`relatedTools` or `threshold`), and resolved origin.

`window.BTRelated.getOrigin()` returns the stable resolved origin used for catalog fetches and relative link resolution.

## Product rule for lonely apps
If an app has no meaningful related tools, do not force recommendations. Either:
- add true `relatedTools` edges once a real product relationship exists, or
- let the widget fall back to `View all apps`.

## Versioning
Apps should pin `related-apps.v1.js`. Future breaking changes must ship in a new versioned filename instead of silently breaking old integrations.
